You will learn exactly how to prepare your assemblies for simulation, how to apply motion elements such as motors, gravity, physical contact, external forces and most importantly how to extract accurate engineering data from your simulations. You will be able, among other things, to determine the power consumption and torque necessaries for your mechanism to work properly.","The course covers a number of differente mechanisms and the list will grow bigger in time as I add new videos.
