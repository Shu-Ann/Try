want to show you how to program 15 digital circuits into an FPGA trainer board using the Xilinx ISE software tool. Each lesson starts by explaining how the logic works in one of the digital circuits. In this course, the programming code for the circuit, in the fpga, will be described with Vhdl programming code. The programming code for each of the 15 circuits, are converted to a bit file and the bit file programs the circuit into an fpga trainer board. The trainer board is now ready to test the circuit. Step by step procedures will show you exactly how to do this course.        Learning how to program an FPGA is just like learning how to drive a car. You can read all about driving a car, but until you get behind the wheel and try it for yourself you won't be able to do it. If you view this entire course and complete everything in it, you will have the knowledge to be able program an FPGA by yourself.","You will learn how to describe a circuit using Vhdl code","15
