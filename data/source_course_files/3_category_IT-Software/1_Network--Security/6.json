An ethical hacker tries to locate vulnerabilities in the network by testing different hacking techniques on them. In many situations, a network seems impenetrable only because it hasn’t succumbed to an attack in years. However, this could be because black hat hackers are using the wrong kinds of methods. An ethical hacker can show a company how they may be vulnerable by levying a new type of attack that no one has ever tried before. When they successfully penetrate the system, the organization can then set up defenses to protect against this kind of penetration. This unique security opportunity makes the skills of an ethical hacker desirable for organizations that want to ensure their systems are well-defended against cybercriminals.","Ethical hacking involves a hacker agreeing with an organization or individual who authorizes the hacker to levy cyber attacks on a system or network to expose potential vulnerabilities. An ethical hacker is also sometimes referred to as a white hat hacker. Many depend on ethical hackers to identify weaknesses in their networks, endpoints, devices, or applications. The hacker informs their client as to when they will be attacking the system, as well as the scope of the attack. An ethical hacker operates within the confines of their agreement with their client. They cannot work to discover vulnerabilities and then demand payment to fix them. This is what gray hat hackers do. Ethical hackers are also different from black hat hackers, who hack to harm others or benefit themselves without permission.","In addition to proficiency in basic computer skills and use of the command line, ethical hackers must also develop technical skills related to programming, database management systems (DBMS), use of the Linux operating system (OS), cryptography, creation and management of web applications and computer networks like DHCP, NAT, and Subnetting. Becoming an ethical hacker involves learning at least one programming language and having a working knowledge of other common languages like Python, SQL, C++, and C. Ethical hackers must have strong problem-solving skills and the ability to think critically to come up with and test new solutions for securing systems. Ethical hackers should also understand how to use reverse engineering to uncover specifications and check a system for vulnerabilities by analyzing its code."],"is_recently_published":false,"last_update_date":"2021-09-21","preview_url":"/course/1289926/preview/","learn_url":"/course/hacking-web-applications-and-learn-penetration-testing/learn/","predictive_score":null,"relevancy_score":null,"input_features":null,"lecture_search_result":null,"curriculum_lectures":[],"order_in_results":null,"curriculum_items":[],"instructor_name":null,"content_info":"4.5 total hours","content_info_short":"4.5 hours","bestseller_badge_content":{"_class":"ds_course_badge","badge_text":"Bestseller","badge_family":"bestseller","context_info":{"subcategory":null,"category":{"id":294,"tracking_object_type":"cat","title":"IT & Software","url":"/courses/it-and-software/"},"label":{"id":26982,"topic_channel_url":"/topic/web-application-security-tester/","display_name":"Web Application Security Tester","tracking_object_type":"cl","title":"Web Application Security Tester","url":"/topic/web-application-security-tester/"}},"id":"0e262232519b43129f30a15178dbe006"},"badges":[{"_class":"ds_course_badge","id":"0e262232519b43129f30a15178dbe006","badge_text":"Bestseller","badge_family":"bestseller","context_info":{"subcategory":null,"category":{"id":294,"tracking_object_type":"cat","title":"IT & Software","url":"/courses/it-and-software/"},"label":{"id":26982,"topic_channel_url":"/topic/web-application-security-tester/","display_name":"Web Application Security Tester","tracking_object_type":"cl","title":"Web Application Security Tester","url":"/topic/web-application-security-tester/"}}}],"free_course_subscribe_url":null,"context_info":{"subcategory":null,"category":{"id":294,"tracking_object_type":"cat","title":"IT & Software","url":"/courses/it-and-software/"},"label":{"id":7110,"topic_channel_url":"/topic/penetration-testing/","display_name":"Penetration Testing","tracking_object_type":"cl","title":"Penetration Testing","url":"/topic/penetration-testing/"}}},{"_class":"course","id":1527914,"title":"OSINT: Open-Source Intelligence","url":"/course/osint-open-source-intelligence/","is_paid":true,"visible_instructors":[{"name":"Jeff","id":8736098,"display_name":"Jeff M","title":"Jeff M","url":"/user/jeffminakata2/","image_50x50":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/8736098_11f8_3.jpg","initials":"JM","_class":"user","job_title":"IT Professional, ethical hacker, Indy Game programmer","image_100x100":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/100x100/8736098_11f8_3.jpg"}],"image_125_H":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/125_H/1527914_cba2.jpg","image_240x135":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/240x135/1527914_cba2.jpg","is_practice_test_course":false,"image_480x270":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/1527914_cba2.jpg","published_title":"osint-open-source-intelligence","tracking_id":"hHw9O03cTOyuHT9OGpeA3g","headline":"For hackers, investigators, and everyone else","num_subscribers":5904,"caption_locales":[{"_class":"locale","locale":"en_US","title":"English (US)","english_title":"English (US)"}],"avg_rating":4.3494625,"avg_rating_recent":4.3420844,"rating":4.3420844,"num_reviews":1399,"is_wishlisted":false,"num_published_lectures":86,"num_published_practice_tests":1,"image_50x50":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/50x50/1527914_cba2.jpg","image_100x100":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/100x100/1527914_cba2.jpg","image_304x171":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/304x171/1527914_cba2.jpg","image_750x422":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/1527914_cba2.jpg","is_in_user_subscription":false,"locale":{"_class":"locale","english_title":"English (US)","simple_english_title":"English","title":"English (US)","locale":"en_US"},"has_closed_caption":true,"caption_languages":["English [Auto]"],"created":"2018-01-26T23:52:54Z","instructional_level":"All Levels","instructional_level_simple":"All Levels","content_length_practice_test_questions":3,"is_user_subscribed":false,"buyable_object_type":"course","published_time":"2018-06-27T21:03:14Z","objectives_summary":["By the end of the course you will have a good understanding of OSINT, how to perform it, the tools necessary, and how your own information online could be used against you.
