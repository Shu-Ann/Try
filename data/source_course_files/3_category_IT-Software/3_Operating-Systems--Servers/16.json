My name is Rajan Arora, and welcome to my course, Installing and Configuring Windows 10. This course will introduce you to installing Windows 10 within a traditional non-cloud environment and some of the choices that you'll need to consider upfront. In this course, we're going to see how to check for system compatibility and where to obtain installation media. You'll see how to migrate from a previous version of Windows and how to perform an in-place upgrade or clean installation of Windows 10. I'll use plenty of scenarios to help you understand the differences. I'll also show you how to configure Windows 10 to multi-boot with another operating system. And throughout this course, there'll be plenty of demonstrations for you to see. By the end of this course, you'll have a good understanding of the installation process and be able to choose the most appropriate Windows edition and installation method for your needs. I hope you'll join me on this journey to learn Windows 10 with the Installing and Configuring Windows 10 course here, at Udemy."],"is_recently_published":false,"last_update_date":"2020-09-27","preview_url":"/course/3529702/preview/","learn_url":"/course/installing-and-configuring-windows-10/learn/","predictive_score":null,"relevancy_score":null,"input_features":null,"lecture_search_result":null,"curriculum_lectures":[],"order_in_results":null,"curriculum_items":[],"instructor_name":null,"content_info":"2
