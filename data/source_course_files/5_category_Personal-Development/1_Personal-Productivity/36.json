have spent the last decade and a half of my life selling-both knowingly and unknowingly. Like most of you, I HATED it; every single bit of it! UNTIL, I learnt it. Anything you don’t know, you try to run away from and hate. The mind loves comfort and safety. But, I didn’t have a choice. With $35 in my bank account, and in a country where I didn’t know anybody, I had to make money. In the process, I got great. The Extraordinary Sales(wo)man is my masterpiece from researching more than 100 books on sales, travelling, selling, making more than 50,000 calls, meeting 10,000 customers, training more than 20,000 people, consulting, coaching, and inventing new sales strategies, and I am proud to present to you my hallmark training program in a never before manner! You name it, I have read, listened, watched, and implemented all strategies. But, nobody I know has got this course together like I have. With my personal insights, expertise, research, discoveries, and inventions for a true sales(wo)man of the digital age, this course is THE ULTIMATE SALES WEAPON! DON’T MISS THIS because this is an introductory price which is going up in the next few days. I don’t bullshit, so let’s get to ACTION!
