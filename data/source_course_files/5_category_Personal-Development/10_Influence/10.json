This Course will teach you to analyze a person's whole handwriting by identifying honest and dishonest traits in the handwriting, identify reliability and dependability indicators, and determine whether someone is going to be a valuable employee on a long-term basis.

Let's face it, majority of people can put on a great performance during an interview, but this Course will allow you to easily pinpoint a person's true attributes and character, which will serve as an additional source of information for you to make the best decision for your business.  In addition, some times people are reliable and great employees, but do not apply to jobs that are befitting to their personality.  For example, if you are shy, then applying for a job having to answer the phone and talk with people in a sales position may not be the best fit for you, but people do it every day and I have seen it so many times.  These methods in this Course will enable you to accurate match the best employee to the right positions, which will streamline your organization for greater success. Level I teaches the fundamentals of handwriting analysis for hiring employees, which is the foundation for the more in-depth concepts discussed in Level II and Level III.  As a whole, you will be equipped with the some of the most advanced techniques for personality and character assessment that is used to hire the best employees everyday on an international level.","This Course is a great training tool for people in the social science field, especially those people who are people watchers or enjoy the science of behavior and personality assessment.  This Course goes in-depth on all different types of personality and character traits and provides an in-depth perspective on compatibility and why certain people are attracted to others with certain personality types and explains the reasons behind this phenomenon.  Whether it is a business or personal relationship, this Course enable you to identify certain characteristics in your own handwriting and present to you handwriting traits that will be in other people's handwriting of those you are attracted to whether it be business or personal.  You will be blown away by the tremendous accuracy of how your friends, business partners or intimate partners all have extremely similar commonalities in their handwriting, which is compatible to your's.  This is not just a Course on handwriting analysis, but also about outward human behavior and how it correlates to handwriting and the life we lead with the people we choose to spend time with.  Each Level in this Course builds on each other to provide you with a full perspective analysis of this dynamic phenomena.","Level III is the final level for this Course and will teach you the powerful method of what I call Form Level, which enables handwriting analysts to verify the conclusions that they have made based on their analysis of a handwriting sample.  Form Level acts as a checks and balances system to completely allow you to verify the accuracy of your results so if you are not sure about certain aspects of your analysis that you conducted, then Form Level will verify those conclusions and provide you with further details of a person's entire personality and character.  Form Level is especially important for those in the business sector and plan to use these techniques for hiring decisions and you will have the comfort of knowing that your results are accurate and consistent every time as this Course's main goal was to make these methods easy to learn and apply.  Level III also goes into trait stroke analysis and goes over the history of how the science of handwriting analysis was first employed.  It goes over every letter of the English alphabet and reveals very interesting deep-rooted personality traits that have been consistent since you were a child.  The most fascinating letter that is covered is the personal pronoun 'i\" which will reveal on a very accurate level the relationship you had with your mother and father or those people who have raised you.  It is a very accurate method and imagine being able to look at the way people form this letter and having the ability to reveal these deep-rooted feelings stemming from your early years as a child and into adulthood.  Many times people subconsciously project these traits without even realizing it as the your parents are those who raised you and are a big part of your life whether good or bad, but nevertheless, these feeling are hidden in the personal pronoun \"i\".  And this Course will teach you how to accurately analyze these letters and successfully determine deep-rooted feelings and characteristics."],"is_recently_published":false,"last_update_date":"2017-12-02","preview_url":"/course/63199/preview/","learn_url":"/course/handwriting-expert/learn/","predictive_score":null,"relevancy_score":null,"input_features":null,"lecture_search_result":null,"curriculum_lectures":[],"order_in_results":null,"curriculum_items":[],"instructor_name":null,"content_info":"2 total hours","content_info_short":"2 hours","bestseller_badge_content":null,"badges":[],"free_course_subscribe_url":null,"context_info":{"label":{"topic_channel_url":"/topic/handwriting-analysis/","url":"/topic/handwriting-analysis/","title":"Handwriting Analysis","display_name":"Handwriting Analysis","id":32970,"tracking_object_type":"cl"},"category":{"url":"/courses/personal-development/","title":"Personal Development","id":296,"tracking_object_type":"cat"},"subcategory":null}},{"_class":"course","id":686918,"title":"Learn 6 Proven Principles Of Persuasion And Influence ","url":"/course/learn-6-proven-principles-of-persuasion-and-influence/","is_paid":true,"visible_instructors":[{"display_name":"Pradeep Aggarwal","name":"Pradeep","_class":"user","url":"/user/pradeepaggarwal/","job_title":"Founder of Institute Of Mind Control & Development, India","image_100x100":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/100x100/5052764_cd10.jpg","title":"Pradeep Aggarwal","image_50x50":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/5052764_cd10.jpg","id":5052764,"initials":"PA"}],"image_125_H":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/125_H/686918_78ee.jpg","image_240x135":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/240x135/686918_78ee.jpg","is_practice_test_course":false,"image_480x270":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/686918_78ee.jpg","published_title":"learn-6-proven-principles-of-persuasion-and-influence","tracking_id":"x8-VYb--RhKepAm8HtDyHA","headline":"Persuasion - Learn 6 Proven Principles Of Persuasion And Influence To Achieve Your Desired Results In Life","num_subscribers":1709,"caption_locales":[{"_class":"locale","locale":"en_US","title":"English (US)","english_title":"English (US)"}],"avg_rating":3.5,"avg_rating_recent":3.3276894,"rating":3.3276894,"num_reviews":14,"is_wishlisted":false,"num_published_lectures":10,"num_published_practice_tests":0,"image_50x50":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/50x50/686918_78ee.jpg","image_100x100":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/100x100/686918_78ee.jpg","image_304x171":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/304x171/686918_78ee.jpg","image_750x422":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/686918_78ee.jpg","is_in_user_subscription":false,"locale":{"locale":"en_US","simple_english_title":"English","title":"English (US)","english_title":"English (US)","_class":"locale"},"has_closed_caption":true,"caption_languages":["English [Auto]"],"created":"2015-12-02T11:00:41Z","instructional_level":"All Levels","instructional_level_simple":"All Levels","content_length_practice_test_questions":0,"is_user_subscribed":false,"buyable_object_type":"course","published_time":"2015-12-02T19:50:34Z","objectives_summary":["By the end of the course you will be more confident and achieve more success while conversing with people and will be able to influence them more effectively than before and achieve your goals","You will learn a powerful relaxation exercise, which will help you relax instantly.
