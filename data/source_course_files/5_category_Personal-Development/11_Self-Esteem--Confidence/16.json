the subject of personal development.  This course is different.  Instead of trying to just change for the better, what ever better is to you, we take a close look at what is holding you back from making solid, long lasting change. Then we look at your imperfections, eliminating those that are superficial.  Then take those imperfections that are left and discover ways to turn them into assets.  It can be done!","There is not one human being on this earth that is perfect.  Sometimes we think that perfection is our goal and until we reach that we are missing the mark.  I will help you understand and embrace that fact that imperfection, in this life is impossible.  Once you embrace that then we can move on to finding joy in your imperfections.","Do you believe any of the following statements are true?  If you do this course is definitely for you: You Have to Always Be In Control, Everyone Cares About What's Going On In Your Life,  Everyone Looks Up to You for Support or as a Standard, Your Parents and Loved Ones Will Not Be Happy if You are Not Perfect, You Always Have to Be Better Than Others, So, Do People Care If You Fail, Happiness is a Destination, What Other People Think About You is More
