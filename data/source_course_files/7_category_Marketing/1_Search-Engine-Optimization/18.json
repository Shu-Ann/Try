Can I guarantee you will end up on the first page of Google? No, that’s not possible because search engine optimization is made up of many  factors.

We walk through that process – a method which can be used on whichever website platform you use.","Social Media:  Keywords can also help you on social media. Pinterest is at heart a search engine and therefore including the keywords you have used in your blogs, sales pages and product descriptions can again help you to get found.
