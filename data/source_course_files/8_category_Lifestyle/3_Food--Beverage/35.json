From making the batter, piping techniques (and fun shapes), to frying through building a churro ice cream sandwich!","Churros are a favorite snack reminiscent of days at an amusement park or a festival.  Churros can be made at home with a few essential techniques that will transport you right back to your favorite memories.  These can be deep fried or prepared in an Air Fryer, although the texture will be a bit different than the norm.  I like to make Ice Cream Sandwiches with them once I've dusted them with cinnamon and sugar, because I enjoy upgrading a homemade treat that is sure to be as over the top as something you would buy at a fair.  Ingredients for Regular and Gluten Free Below:  Tools you will need for Churros:  One Medium Mixing Bowl Hand Mixer or Stand Mixer (use the lower speeds for this) Medium Sauce Pot Wooden Spoon Silicone Spatula Large Disposable Piping Bag Large Star Tip (the opening should be larger than your finger) Sheet Tray(S) or Cookie Sheet(S) with saran wrap, parchment paper, wax paper or a silicone mat Candy Thermometer Large Wide Sauté Pan or Braising Pan with Neutral Oil Or Air Fryer  Ingredients for Churros: (Pate A Choux Batter) 1.5 Cups AP Flour 1.5 Cups Water 6 Eggs 1 Tsp Sugar 1/2 Tsp Salt (Kosher or Sea Salt) 1 Stick + 1TBSP (9 TBSP altogether) Butter, Cubed Cinnamon and Sugar for coating post fry.  Gluten Free Version: 1 Cup GF 1 to 1 Flour (Must contain Xanthan Gum) 1 Cup Water 1 Stick (8 TBSP) Butter, Cubed 5 Eggs 3 TBSP Sugar 1/4 Tsp Salt (Kosher or Sea) Cinnamon and Sugar for coating post fry.  To make your own no-churn ice cream to make this next level: Whip Two Cups of heavy cream with 1 Tsp Vanilla until it becomes fluffy firm whipped cream, then fold in 1 14oz. can of Condensed Milk just until it comes together, taking care not to over fold all of the whipped are right out.  Freeze in a wide baking dish or a sheet tray and it should be ready to use just as you're finishing the churros."],"is_recently_published":false,"last_update_date":"2021-03-16","preview_url":"/course/3902818/preview/","learn_url":"/course/churros4life/learn/","predictive_score":null,"relevancy_score":null,"input_features":null,"lecture_search_result":null,"curriculum_lectures":[],"order_in_results":null,"curriculum_items":[],"instructor_name":null,"content_info":"30 total mins","content_info_short":"30 mins","bestseller_badge_content":null,"badges":[],"free_course_subscribe_url":null,"context_info":{"category":{"id":274,"tracking_object_type":"cat","url":"/courses/lifestyle/","title":"Lifestyle"},"subcategory":null,"label":{"id":5240,"title":"Cooking","display_name":"Cooking","tracking_object_type":"cl","topic_channel_url":"/topic/cooking/","url":"/topic/cooking/"}}},{"_class":"course","id":4258684,"title":"Moroccan Food Course: Moroccan Couscous","url":"/course/moroccan-food-course-moroccan-couscous-engfr/","is_paid":true,"visible_instructors":[{"title":"Zahra Labiad","initials":"ZL","display_name":"Zahra Labiad","job_title":"Chef Cuisinière","id":167750472,"image_100x100":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/100x100/167750472_540f_2.jpg","name":"Zahra","_class":"user","image_50x50":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/167750472_540f_2.jpg","url":"/user/zahra-labiad/"}],"image_125_H":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/125_H/4258684_550a.jpg","image_240x135":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/240x135/4258684_550a.jpg","is_practice_test_course":false,"image_480x270":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/4258684_550a.jpg","published_title":"moroccan-food-course-moroccan-couscous-engfr","tracking_id":"IXrtLC2kRl-BGV8eeSmDsg","headline":"Learn how to cook couscous by the end of this cours!","num_subscribers":0,"caption_locales":[],"avg_rating":0,"avg_rating_recent":0,"rating":0,"num_reviews":0,"is_wishlisted":false,"num_published_lectures":5,"num_published_practice_tests":0,"image_50x50":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/50x50/4258684_550a.jpg","image_100x100":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/100x100/4258684_550a.jpg","image_304x171":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/304x171/4258684_550a.jpg","image_750x422":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4258684_550a.jpg","is_in_user_subscription":false,"locale":{"title":"English (US)","locale":"en_US","simple_english_title":"English","english_title":"English (US)","_class":"locale"},"has_closed_caption":false,"caption_languages":[],"created":"2021-08-23T13:04:49Z","instructional_level":"All Levels","instructional_level_simple":"All Levels","content_length_practice_test_questions":0,"is_user_subscribed":false,"buyable_object_type":"course","published_time":"2021-09-12T13:29:13Z","objectives_summary":["Master basic techniques to be able to make your own Moroccan couscous at home.","Be a little more familiar with Moroccan cuisine by the end of the cours.
