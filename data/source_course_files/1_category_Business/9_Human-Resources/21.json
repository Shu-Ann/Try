What I help you do is get an understanding of the job early in the interview so you can talk about what you've doe that matters to them and not just talk about what you've done. You'll learn the best way to answer, \"Tell me about yourseld\" to connect the dots for the interviewer so they know you fit the role quickly. Tell stories that sell your experience and great questions to ask at the end of the interview. I have a section dealing with the unique requirements of video interviews as well as what to do if the phone rings out of the blue with someone wanting to interview you. This will help you if you haven't interview in a long time or if your nerves get the better of you.","What makes you qualified to teach about interviewing?","I am a former executive recruiter with many years of experience who now is a career coach.
