course is designed to help you boost your IELTS speaking score and thus raise your overall result. It's taught by Misa Zhang, a top sales executive, and a non-native speaker who achieved a band 9 in her IELTS speaking test. In the program, you’ll learn not only the “technical skills” demanded in the official IELTS scoring criteria, but also the critical “people skills” Misa perfected during 10 years as a sales professional for top global companies, such as Dow Jones, The Wall Street Journal, Thomson Reuters and Wood McKenzie. In this intensive 1.5 hour course, you’ll discover the secrets to her success — not only in the IELTS examination but in building a rewarding life in a major English-speaking
