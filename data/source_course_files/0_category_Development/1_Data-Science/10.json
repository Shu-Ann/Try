Intelligence (AI) revolution is here!  “Artificial Intelligence market worldwide is projected to grow by US$284.6 Billion driven by a compounded growth of 43. 9%. Deep Learning, one of the segments analyzed and sized in this study, displays the potential to grow at over 42. 5%.” [1] AI is the science that empowers computers to mimic human intelligence such as decision making, reasoning, text processing, and visual perception. AI is a broader general field that entails several subfield such as machine learning, robotics, and computer vision. For companies to become competitive and skyrocket their growth, they need to leverage Artificial Intelligence (AI) power to improve processes, reduce cost and increase revenue. AI is broadly implemented in many sectors nowadays and has been transforming every industry from banking to healthcare, transportation and technology.  The demand for AI talent has exponentially increased in recent years and it’s no longer limited to Silicon Valley! According to Forbes, AI Skills are among the most in-demand for 2020 [2]. The purpose of this course is to provide you with knowledge of key aspects of modern Artificial Intelligence applications in a practical, easy and fun way. The course provides students with practical hands-on experience using real-world datasets. One key unique feature of this course is that we will be training and deploying models using Tensorflow and AWS SageMaker. In addition, we will cover various elements of the AI/ML workflow covering model building, training, hyper-parameters","Deploy Emotion AI-based model using Tensorflow 2.0 Serving and use the model to make inference.","Understand the concept of Explainable AI and uncover the blackbox nature of Artificial Neural Networks and visualize their hidden layers using GradCam technique."],"is_recently_published":false,"last_update_date":"2021-06-27","preview_url":"/course/3291418/preview/","learn_url":"/course/modern-artificial-intelligence-applications/learn/","predictive_score":null,"relevancy_score":null,"input_features":null,"lecture_search_result":null,"curriculum_lectures":[],"order_in_results":null,"curriculum_items":[],"instructor_name":null,"content_info":"16 total hours","content_info_short":"16 hours","bestseller_badge_content":null,"badges":[],"free_course_subscribe_url":null,"context_info":{"category":{"url":"/courses/development/","id":288,"tracking_object_type":"cat","title":"Development"},"label":{"topic_channel_url":"/topic/artificial-intelligence/","id":4624,"tracking_object_type":"cl","title":"Artificial Intelligence","url":"/topic/artificial-intelligence/","display_name":"Artificial Intelligence"},"subcategory":null}},{"_class":"course","id":1568464,"title":"Complete Linear Algebra for Data Science & Machine Learning","url":"/course/linear-algebra-for-beginners-matrices-and-vector-spaces/","is_paid":true,"visible_instructors":[{"image_50x50":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/19826656_610e.jpg","id":19826656,"display_name":"Kashif A.","initials":"KA","job_title":"Bestselling Instructor","_class":"user","title":"Kashif A.","url":"/user/kashif-altaf/","image_100x100":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/100x100/19826656_610e.jpg","name":"Kashif"}],"image_125_H":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/125_H/1568464_c455_5.jpg","image_240x135":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/240x135/1568464_c455_5.jpg","is_practice_test_course":false,"image_480x270":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/1568464_c455_5.jpg","published_title":"linear-algebra-for-beginners-matrices-and-vector-spaces","tracking_id":"3EHkxVPET-y8SSOBQQ90zw","headline":"Linear Algebra for Data Science, Big Data, Machine Learning, Engineering & Computer Science.
